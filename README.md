This repository hosts the sources of my academic webpage. 
This is a custom adaptation of a static https://html5up.net/ template that has been heavily modified and stripped down. 

I have also developed scripts to extract publication records from HAL and to automatically generate a publications HTML page, 
as well as generating a directory structure for publication specific pages.
